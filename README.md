particle-sim
@joveliz

This is a simple particle simulator visualization inspired by many youtube videos exploring the topic of emergence. Since this is meant to run in the browser, I added a spatial hash grid to optimize the proximity detection between particles, which was based on @simondevyoutube implementation.

I find the sim meets its purpose as is, but maybe I will come back to this in the future and add a UI to experiment more with the number of particles and their behaviour.
